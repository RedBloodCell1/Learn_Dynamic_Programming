Day 1:

- Today i will learn about dynamic programming

What i learn today:

1. Memoization = hashmap, dictionary in python. Simply mapping what we have get before to the map
2. Solve fibonacci problem
3. Time complexity:
   - O(n) time is simply it runs n number of time // O(n) space is how much space it took from the problem, at one time
   - But lets not forget that any multiplicative values can be removed as it doesnt matter that much EX: O(n/2) -> O(n)
